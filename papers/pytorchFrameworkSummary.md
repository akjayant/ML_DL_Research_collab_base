This is the summary of the paper of the pytorch framework.

- Pytorch gives both speed and usability.
- It provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.
- It performs immediate execution of dynamic tensor computations with automatic differentiation and
GPU acceleration, and does so while maintaining performance comparable to the fastest current
libraries for deep learning.

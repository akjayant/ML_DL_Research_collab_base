## 1. Classification:

###### Challenges:

Since this task of recognizing a visual concept (e.g. cat) is relatively trivial for a human to perform, it is worth considering the challenges involved from the perspective of a Computer Vision algorithm. As we present (an inexhaustive) list of challenges below, keep in mind the raw representation of images as a 3-D array of brightness values:

- Viewpoint variation. A single instance of an object can be oriented in many ways with respect to the camera.
- Scale variation. Visual classes often exhibit variation in their size (size in the real world, not only in terms of their extent in the image).
- Deformation. Many objects of interest are not rigid bodies and can be deformed in extreme ways.
- Occlusion. The objects of interest can be occluded. Sometimes only a small portion of an object (as little as few pixels) could be visible.
- Illumination conditions. The effects of illumination are drastic on the pixel level.
- Background clutter. The objects of interest may blend into their environment, making them hard to identify.
- Intra-class variation. The classes of interest can often be relatively broad, such as chair. There are many different types of these objects, each with their own appearance.
- A good image classification model must be invariant to the cross product of all these variations, while simultaneously retaining sensitivity to the inter-class variations.

L1 distance: d_1 (I_1, I_2) = $ `\sum_{p} \left| I^p_1 - I^p_2 \right|` $      \
L2 distance: d_2 (I_1, I_2) = $ `\sqrt{\sum_{p} \left( I^p_1 - I^p_2 \right)^2}` $
